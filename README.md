# UCSD CSE150 ML-ProbabilityApproach

HW2:  Used Python to implement a Hangman Game where a random vocabulary is generated and then the computer will give a list of 
probability corresponding to which of the 26 letters will be the next character based on a large corpse of text from Washington
Times and the list of previous guessed or confirmed characters, sample demo and source code are available

HW5:  Used Python to implement a simple Movie Recommendation System using EM algorithm that takes in an input of a 117x61 matrix
recording 117 students’ ratings to 61 movies (like, don’t like, or not seen), and it will use the trained model to update the
conditional probability table (CPT) during each iteration to increase the log-likelihood until it finally converges and be able
to predict the expected preferences of unseen movies for every student

HW6: Vieterbi Algorithm

HW7: Value Iteration
